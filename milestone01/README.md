#Milestone 1

##Setup the Development Environment
As discussed in class, OS development requires a specialized build environment. For the first milesonte you need access to this environment. Ensure you are up-to-date on all class readings before continuing. You have a few different options:

- Download and use the .ova image I have already set up with your favorite VMM. The user name and password are both "cpe454".
- Install on your existing Linux installation and/or create your own VM. The steps for this are:
    - Ubuntu 20.04 LTS virtual machine (my preference) or native boot. Make sure the VM has at least 2GB of memory.
    - Qemu virtual machine for testing.
    - nasm for assembly
    - gcc cross-compiler targeting x86_64-elf. Follow the directions from the OSDev Wiki. 

Whatever you decide to do, make sure you have access to the development environment during our lab time. The computers in lab will not have the correct software installed.
