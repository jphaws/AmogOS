# AmogOS
AmogOS is a small custom kernel that I implemented in Cal Poly's Implementation of Operating Systems course (CSC-454) during Spring 2022. 
It is written for single-core x86_64 CPUs with support for keyboard input, VGA output, serial output, virtual memory, and interrupts. 

See [milestones](milestones) for  more specific operating system features and implementation guidelines. 

Building AmogOS requires a cross compiler be placed in `~/opt/cross/bin/` compiled with flags specified in [Milestone 1](milestones/Milestone1.md)
